## Thechnology Explain
+ [Springboot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
Spring Boot is a new framework provided by the Pivotal team that is designed to simplify the initial setup and development of new Spring applications. The framework uses a specific approach to configuration, eliminating the need for developers to define boilerplate configurations. In this way, Spring Boot is committed to being a leader in the booming rapid application development.</br>
 *Feature: * </br>
1. Create a standalone Spring application
2. Embedded Tomcat, no need to deploy WAR files
3. Simplify Maven configuration
4. Automatically configure Spring
5. Provide production-ready features such as indicators, health checks and external configurations
6. There is absolutely no code generation and no configuration requirements for XML 

+ [Flask in Python](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/)
Flask is a lightweight web application framework written in Python. Based on the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and the Jinja2 template engine. Flask uses BSD licenses.

Flask is called "microframework" because it uses a simple core and adds other features with extension. Flask does not have a database or form validation tool that is used by default. However, Flask retains the flexibility of amplification, which can be added with Flask-extension: ORM, form validation tools, file uploads, and various open authentication technologies.</br>
*Feature*<br>
1. Built-in development server and debugger
2. Integrated unit testing
3. RESTful request distribution
4. Using the Jinja2 template engine
5. Support for secure cookies (client sessions)
6. 100% WSGI 1.0 compatible
7. Based on Unicode
8. Detailed documentation, teaching
9. Google App Engine compatible
10. Additional features can be added with Extensions

[Jinjia2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/)
Jinja2 is one of the most used template engines for Python. It is inspired by Django's templating system but extends it with an expressive language that gives template authors a more powerful set of tools. On top of that it adds sandboxed execution and optional automatic escaping for applications where security is important.

It is internally based on Unicode and runs on a wide range of Python versions from 2.4 to current versions including Python 3.
