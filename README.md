# BigProject (Online-Shopping Web Application)
This project is the 4th year big project. That is a online Shopping Web Application
> Model: APPLIED PROJECT AND MINOR DISSERTATION

> Student: Tianle Shu

> Supervisor: Martin Hynes

## Overview
This final year Project is Online-Shopping Web Application. It with the objective to develop a basic website where consumer is provided with a shopping cart application and to know about the technologies used to develop such as an application.

## Thechnology Explain
+ [Springboot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
Spring Boot is a new framework provided by the Pivotal team that is designed to simplify the initial setup and development of new Spring applications. The framework uses a specific approach to configuration, eliminating the need for developers to define boilerplate configurations. In this way, Spring Boot is committed to being a leader in the booming rapid application development.</br>
 *Feature: * </br>
1. Create a standalone Spring application
2. Embedded Tomcat, no need to deploy WAR files
3. Simplify Maven configuration
4. Automatically configure Spring
5. Provide production-ready features such as indicators, health checks and external configurations
6. There is absolutely no code generation and no configuration requirements for XML 

+ [Flask in Python](http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/1.0/)
Flask is a lightweight web application framework written in Python. Based on the Werkzeug WSGI toolkit and the Jinja2 template engine. Flask uses BSD licenses.

Flask is called "microframework" because it uses a simple core and adds other features with extension. Flask does not have a database or form validation tool that is used by default. However, Flask retains the flexibility of amplification, which can be added with Flask-extension: ORM, form validation tools, file uploads, and various open authentication technologies.</br>
*Feature*<br>
1. Built-in development server and debugger
2. Integrated unit testing
3. RESTful request distribution
4. Using the Jinja2 template engine
5. Support for secure cookies (client sessions)
6. 100% WSGI 1.0 compatible
7. Based on Unicode
8. Detailed documentation, teaching
9. Google App Engine compatible
10. Additional features can be added with Extensions

+ [Jinjia2](http://jinja.pocoo.org/)
Jinja2 is one of the most used template engines for Python. It is inspired by Django's templating system but extends it with an expressive language that gives template authors a more powerful set of tools. On top of that it adds sandboxed execution and optional automatic escaping for applications where security is important.

It is internally based on Unicode and runs on a wide range of Python versions from 2.4 to current versions including Python 3.

+ [Docker](https://www.docker.com/)
Docker is an open source software project that automates the deployment of applications under software containers, providing an additional layer of software abstraction and an automated management mechanism for operating system layer virtualization on the Linux operating system.

Docker uses resource separation mechanisms in the Linux kernel, such as cgroups, and Linux core namespaces to create separate containers. This can operate under a single Linux entity, avoiding the extra burden of booting a virtual machine [2]. The Linux kernel's support for namespaces completely isolates the application's view of the work environment, including the trip tree, network, user ID, and mount file system, while the core cgroup provides resource isolation, including CPU, memory, block I/O, and The internet. Since version 0.9, Dockers has used Abstract Virtual to provide an interface through libvirt's LXC and systemd-nspawn, starting with the libcontainer library as a way to start using the virtualization provided by the Linux kernel in its own way.

+ [aws cloud](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker)
Amazon Web Services (English: Amazon Web Services, abbreviated AWS), a cloud computing platform created by Amazon, provides many remote web services. Both Amazon EC2 and Amazon S3 are architected on this platform. It was first publicly operated in July 2002, providing other websites and client-side services.</br>
Whether you're running a photo sharing app with millions of mobile users or supporting the critical operations of your business, the cloud services platform gives you quick access to flexible, low-cost IT resources. With cloud computing, you don't have to invest heavily in hardware and spend a lot of time maintaining and managing the hardware.
